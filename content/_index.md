I do a few things: 


- I'm building [`ricochet.rs`](https://ricochet.rs) an enterprise deployment platform for R, Julia, and Python
- Build and maintain the [R-ArcGIS Bridge](https://developers.arcgis.com/r-bridge/) at [Esri](https://esri.com)

This is a test page to verify that Zola, Tailwind CSS, and Basecoat are all working together.
