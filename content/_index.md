I'm glad you're here! My name is Josiah and I believe **R belongs in production**. 

<div class="aside">
    My name is pronounced "joe-sigh-uh".

- I'm building [`ricochet.rs`](https://ricochet.rs) an enterprise deployment platform for R, Julia, and Python
- Build and maintain the [R-ArcGIS Bridge](https://developers.arcgis.com/r-bridge/) at [Esri](https://esri.com)
- Help maintain [extendr](https://extendr.rs) which lets you write R packages using Rust—think PyO3 for R.


If your organization needs to deploy R, Julia, or Python (apps, APIs, scheduled tasks, or persistent services) at scale, or you want to talk about integrating Rust with R, get in touch: `josiah at ricochet.rs`.
